# OpenMP-mergesort

 I wrote this code  to merge-sort an array of numbers using OpenMP API (4 threads used) during "Architecture of parallel systems" university course.
 OpenMP is an Application Programming Interface (API) for creating parallel programs that run on shared-memory systems, primarily using compiler directives, library routines, and     environment variables
